# ToDoList Advance Project
## Introduction
This project implements the Front-End for a simple To-Do List web application, using the React JS library, and also Styled Components replacing pure CSS.<br/>
It includes the login page and the general UI of the app. <br/>
The login authentication logic and the tasks database for each user are not implemented, since this project aims to be a Front-End study only.





## Functionalities
â€¢Implement user authentication using a secure token-based authentication
such as JWT. Without login, the user should not be able to see the dashboard.
2. The app should use React Context API to store login user information.
3. Implement the logout functionality.
4. In the dashboard, add a button through which new Todos can be added,
when creating a todo it can be stored in a global context.
5. Add a feature that allows the addition of Nested Todo, (Sub Task), It is
entirely up to you how you design this feature. get inspiration from existing
Todo apps
6. Make sure to sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

7. Implement a route guard that requires the user to be successfully
authenticated before they can view their dashboard. If the user is not
authenticated, they should be redirected to the login page.
8. Implement proper error handling in the code.
9. Use your own creativity to make a better user experience.
10. The app can be hosted on any platform i.e Netlify, or Vercel. And source
code should be publically accessible on any git repository to review.
11. The source code must be in Typescript.


Obs.: currently, the "edit task" and adding or removing categories functionalities are not implemented,  Maybe I'll implement this later on.
